The mechanic arrived at 7:30. We changed the primary and secondary fuel filters. A manual "bulb" fuel pump was installed in the line replacing the electric diesel pump. The engine seemed to run with some occasional manual bleeding at the injector pump.
There was some water flowing to the bilge from the side of the engine (later determined to be overflow from the fresh water anti-siphon).
At 13:24 we started motoring north with the intention to get closed to the Baltic sea. Susanna sat in front of the engine, ready to bleed the injector if the engine were to sputter. And sputter it did. Constantly. So after few minutes we decided this wasn't going to work, and stopped at the nearby marina Brieselang at 13:52. The day run was a glorious 2.1NM.
At 15:02 Berndt arrived. We removed the clearly leaky manual fuel pump with a continuous fuel hose. Now the engine was running better again. We ordered pizza to the marina and paid for 4h of electricity to top up the batteries.
