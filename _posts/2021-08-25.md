We took the opportunity of the stormy day to explore the cute little fishing town of Simrishamn.
The westerly wind did a quite significant drop in water levels, as was seen at the marina beach.
Simrishamn was also good for provisioning. We filled the water tanks at the pier, recharged batteries, and enjoyed the availability of Finnish foods and snacks at a typical Swedish supermarket. The difference in attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic were quite apparent from the scared looks of other shoppers because we were wearing masks.
