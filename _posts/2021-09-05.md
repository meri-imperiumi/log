Left the harbour at 9:50 under engine.
At 11:52 we entered the Szczecin Lagoon, and hoisted sails. However, the winds were weak and by 13:15 we were motoring again.
We arrived to the AZS marina at 18:34. Initially we took just some box, but the owner arrived later and instructed us to look for a box with a green marker.
We booked the mast crane for the next morning.
