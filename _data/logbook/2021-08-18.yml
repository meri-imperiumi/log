  text: We ordered hoses and hose clamps from local car shop. They got delivered at 13. After that Suski replaced all diesel lines and tried to run the motor. No success. Try 2 was to bypass 1st filter. No success. Neighbours shout, we stopped. Try 3 was to bypass the tank. Works. Georg came and added a new hose fitting to tank. We attached the diesel intake in it. No success. We took off the return hose for diesel and found a blockage. Attached return hose to new fitting. Success!
