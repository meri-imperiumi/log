  text: We were stuck aground while trying to leave. The water level had dropped
    by 20 or so cm and we did not take it into account. We tried to reverse over
    the hump, but no luck. Suski went to the bow, did not help, Bergie came too.
    Did not help. We brought the anchor line to front and pulled. It dragged us
    deeper to the shallow because pulling from the bow only turns, we should
    have put it through the back cleat first. So we put the engine on forward
    tucker and both bulled on the anchor line in the bow. We heeled enough that
    the foreward tucker pushed us over the rock and we were released. Expected
    damage, scratches on the keel at the back.
