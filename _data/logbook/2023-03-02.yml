    Window maintenance for 8/10 windows (toilet and hallway not done).


    Lichen dried out in front of diesel heater conduit. Extra wetness wiped off from window with kitchen roll paper and then initial and very careful drying with hot air gun followed by warming up the outside window with hot air gun before installing the inside windows with all dried up lichen in between.
