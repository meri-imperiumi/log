  text: Guten Morgen... Georg arrives 2.5 hours before the appointment... Filter 1 and 2 changed. "Are we friends or not, why would you call me to a job like this" = the second filter is really difficult to get to. Installed a new line with a manual pump before filter 1 engine ran in 10 minute intervals. Georg & Bernd & us decided as we can now bleed the system we are going to head out.
