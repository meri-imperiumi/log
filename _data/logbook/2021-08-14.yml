  text: Motor died yesterday 1:20h after locks when reducing RPMs. Bled aid from fuel filter + lift pump. Checked oil level - halfway between markings. Cleaned tank air intake. Berndt was able to start motor by pumping lift pump manually for half minute before, then also during starting and for a while after. Removed filter before pre-pump (was on w/zip ties)
