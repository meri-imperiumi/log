  In 2023 we sailed a bit over 3000NM around the island of Rügen. The trip took us from Poland west to Greifswalder Bodden, Stralsund, west of Hiddensee and up north to Swedish Höga Kusten, Töre, Haparandahamn, Tornio and then back towards south via Marjaniemi, Kokkola, Turku and then to complete the Finnish coast to Tallinn, Hamina and back towards west and Mariehamn, Visby, Kalmar and Swinoujscie to complete the loop around Rügen. Might not have been the fastest “Around Rügen” of all times, but at least we got to sail a lot!
