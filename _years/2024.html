  This summer it was time to put our skills and the boat to the test. And so we planned a summer spent cruising the Scottish west coast. This trip would take us through treacherous tidal waters and the waves of the open Atlantic Ocean. And if our first offshore passages on the way there were successful, we'd follow that up with a sail to the warm islands of Madeira and the Canaries for the fall.
