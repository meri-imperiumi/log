  This year Lille Ø took us through the treacherous tidal waters of Scotland and the big waves of the open Atlantic Ocean to the warm waters of the Canary Islands. After careful consideration of historical weather data we made a plan that would take us on a progressively more difficult sailing trajectory to prepare us for our dream of taking Lille Ø to the sunny and warm south. Along the 5300NM we have encountered challenges that we could overcome, successes we could celebrate, and the contrast between northern waters and tropical bliss.
