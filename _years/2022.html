    We sailed in the protection of the Swedish and Finnish archipelago for five months and 2500 nautical miles, starting from Easter 2022. Our aim was to enjoy the protected anchorages and explore the natural beauty and sailability of the archipelago for as long as possible.

    The ability to work remotely in the boat office made this all possible powered by our solar panels and the 4G networks of the Nordic countries. We explored the Gulf of Finland all the way to Loviisa and came back 5 months later with some provisions still left in the bilge that were bought in Berlin. We stayed in 42 different natural harbours along the way. We managed to sail on â…” of the days on the trip.
