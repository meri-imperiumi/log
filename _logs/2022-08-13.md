Today's new experience was taking a dog on board. Salsa seemed to take it all in good stride, despite some exciting sea life we passed by.

Very light wind day. We were able to sail for a few hours, but then motored to the nature harbour of Modermagan. Then some nature trails, BBQ, and plenty of chances for the dog to swim. Entertainment was provided by US armed forces with helicopters and fighter jets buzzing over us.
