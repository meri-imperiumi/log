Wind is a rare treat here, and one not to be ignored. As a matter of fact, we have sailed more miles in Guna Yala with Isosaari than with Lille Ø.

As there was a nice breeze in forecast for today, we decided to hoist anchor and stage us to the west end of the archipelago. Logistics are happening, and we need to be closer to the bigger cities soon.

Two gybes to clear the reefs around Swimming Pool, and what followed was a lovely broad reach down the archipelago. If you squint, this could be around Stockholm with the hundreds of protected anchorages filled with sailboats. Just, palm trees instead of pines.

Now we're anchored in the tourist spot of Chichime. Very protected, but with constant traffic moving backpackers in and out of the mainland.
