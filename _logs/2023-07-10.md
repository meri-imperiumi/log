We celebrated the nice sunny morning by making the breakfast and coffee on the grill on shore. Then we detached from the buoy and motored the short hop around the island to our destination.

Now we're again stern anchored off a friend's summer cottage, this time hugged closely by the reeds. Arriving to the pier was tricky as the reeds were thick enough that our engine was nearly not able to push us forward. The lady couple of meters we had to do by ropes.

Now starts a week of sauna, hot tub, and board games!
