Yesterday we completed the haulout task list, and were able to splash the boat this morning. After clearing the chaos on board that this always created, now we can focus on replenishing the ship's stores for the trip ahead.

As always, we didn't complete everything on our winter list. This means there are still things we need to do either under way to Szczecin, as well as things we can do when anchored and waiting for weather.

If everything works out, we'll head out on Saturday morning. Right now the weather forecast looks like summer in early April.
