Today's sail started with some rain. We continued on a beam reach along the increasingly busy fairway east. At some point sun came out.

After consulting the weather forecast and maps, we decided to keep today's sail a bit shorter. We tied up to a SXK buoy inside a group of skerries. Again a pretty spot, but very rolly.
