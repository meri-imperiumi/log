After several days of high winds, today dawned with a total windstill. After breakfast we left the pier at the nature harbour and started motoring towards the narrow Suni strait. At least we could motor to a different nature harbour, we thought.

When we reached the west side of the island of Pellinki, a light breeze picked up. Enough to sail, albeit slowly. But as the fairway is pretty wide in the area, this allowed nice long lazy tacks.

Once we passed Cape Em√§salo the wind picked up a bit and the sun came out. Suddenly we were actually doing quite enjoyable 5kt on a beam reach. At that point we revised out target and decided to head to Helsinki already today. This should provide a bit more time for seeing friends and acquiring provisions.

The wind died again when we passed Vuosaari, and so we motored to the Hevossalmi turning bridge. This is a handy shortcut to Helsinki from the east. The bridge opens every half an hour during daytime. We're tied up at the by now familiar HMVK pier.
