Karlskrona is a Unesco-listed Baroque city and the main base of the Swedish Navy.
We spent the day exploring the Navy museum and the old city center.
Quite a grey day, and much of the museum was closed due to Corona restrictions, but it was still definitely worthwhile to see!
As Sweden has affordable cheese, we also stocked up the fridge.
We also used the time to do configure some navigation electronics upgrades. A very nice one was setting up saillogger.com for the boat. This software automatically monitors the vessel and provides electronic log entries, remote vessel monitoring and statistics.
We also started sending the ship's weather data (barometric pressure, temperature, and wind) to the windy.com service to help improve forecasts around us.
