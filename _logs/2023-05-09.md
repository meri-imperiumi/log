title: 'Ankarudden - Nyn채shamn'
---

Weather dictates when we wake up and when we set sail. We are expecting a gale coming in this evening, so we left early in the morning to sail the last 10 NM to Nyn채shamn. We hoisted the main sail when still tied to the buoy and sailed away, motor running on neutral, just in case. With a 60째 wind angle we then rolled out the genoa and left the anchorage in style.

In two hours we were already moored in Nyn채shamn.  It is time to wash _all_ the laundry. Also finally we have reached the territory where every marina has a sauna! The adventure continues next week when we start exploring the Stockholm archipelago.
