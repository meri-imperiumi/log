title: Project Season
---

The saying goes: when the ToDo list for your boat is empty, it is time to sell the boat because you clearly don't love it anymore. No fear of that for us in the hot climate of Curaçao. In the past five months, Lille Ø has undergone a major transformation. The biggest undertaking we took was to build a hard dodger instead of the sprayhood that was quickly falling apart in the unforgiving bombartment of tropical sun.

The ToDo list has now been depleted, but it is not empty. The first tasks of things to do when certain parts come available with a reasonable price are already waiting.

Spanish Water has had a quite fun cruiser community, with plenty of activities from beach bonfires to wing foiling and pizza cookouts. But as the hurricane season winds down, the boats are starting to scatter towards all compass directions.

The forecast looks light, but that is how we like it for the first sail with the improved version of Lille Ø.
