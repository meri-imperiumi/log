Sometimes the best plans come out short. Suski woke up early to the sounds of rain. With an all time speed record through the boat she was out and collecting the towels from the guard rails before they got soaking wet.

As the gusts grew higher and they hit us beam on we knew it was only a matter of time before we would drag to the rocks next to us. So rain jacket on, gather the lines from the shore and reverse out. We changed from stern to bow anchor and waited the squall to pass.

While it was raining we had breakfast and re-checked the weather prognosis. With a new 180° wind shift we were now looking at being fully exposed to the high winds in the evening, and the whole bay being a dangerous lee shore.

We decided to change anchorages and seek shelter from a nearby SXK harbour and mooring field instead. So we motored on for the next hour. Now we are in a even more protected bay swinging from the buoy ready for all of the wind directions. And there is even a sauna on the shore!
