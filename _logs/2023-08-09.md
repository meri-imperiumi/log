The morning after the storm both the wind and the waves had quieted down significantly. We prepared the boat and hoisted anchor at noon in a drizzle. As the wind continued the be southerly, we had plotted a course to the outer archipelago fairway.

Since some heavier gusts were in the forecast, we started with the staysail and single-reefed main. This proved to be a good combination in the beginning, propelling us on a brisk beam reach.

Around lunchtime we were overtaken by a thunderstorm coming across from Estonia. As the gusts climbed above 34kt, we switched to the second reef, the off-watch getting a good soak in the process. This wind was however short-lived, and soon we were back on the first reef.

We selected the old fishing village of Jurmo as today's stop. Quite unique nature to see. And of course the anleger, this time sponsored by Marco. Kippis!
