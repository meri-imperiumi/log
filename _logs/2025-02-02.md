After our breakfast we hoisted sails and headed out. Destination Tobago Cays and its picture perfect palm beaches. As the squalls are a daily occurrence we left with staysail and first reef.

The day progressed with a nice beam reach and made good progress.  In the afternoon we had couple of squalls and went down to second reef. Some of us enjoyed the rain more than others.
