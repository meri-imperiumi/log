The second wind did indeed come, and we were able to sail with a pleasant light beam reach until just past midnight. Then it was engine on, and nose towards Puerto Obaldia.

We made landfall at dawn, with a beautiful misty and mountainous rainforest landscape opening before us. This is the famous Darien Gap. We just had to play some Vangelis.

Anchor went down at 7:00. Then a quick shower, coffee, and the dinghy into the water. We landed at the local beach and went through the Panamanian border formalities. Immigration, maritime authorities, and the border police later we had been stamped them into the country.

The Puerto Obaldia anchorage was quite rolly, and so three hours after arrival we packed the dinghy, hoisted anchor, and motored on into Guna Yala proper. This is an autonomous region inhabited by the indigenous Guna people.

We sailed past the bay of New Caledonia of the ill-fated Scottish Darien Scheme, and were soon met by the dinghy from _Plan B_. They guided us through the pass into the Suledub anchorage. Now we have a beautiful archipelago to explore!
